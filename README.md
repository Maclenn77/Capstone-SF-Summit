## Microverse - Capstone Project (Conference)

This is a Capstone project for Microverse. This is a page for Sci-Fi Summit, based in the design of [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) .

#### Navbar

In the Navbar section with have a menu that it expands from up of 768px and it shows like  a toggler for mobile version. This feature is achieved with Bootstrap. This is the same feature for all the pages.

#### Main
Main section contains all the needed info in each HTML page. I combined bootstrap and CSS files for the style.

In the index file I used a jumbotron in the first part. I prefered to use semantic tags for dividing the sections in CSS. Divs are only used for styling.

Index and About have a section showing the partners of the event. In index, this part is only showed for desktop.

#### Footer

All the pages have a footer with Logo and Copyright info.
